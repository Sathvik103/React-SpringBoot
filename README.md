This is a Sample Project acting as a staircase for my upcoming projects.
This is a simple Course-Shopping Website with simple implementations of a cart, Course Library and a Login.
This project is built using React frontend and SpringBoot backend, using mySql as the backend source.
It uses simple relations from the database and implements simple functions such as adding to cart, deleting from cart, Searching of Courses and even saving a course with minor details about the 
course faculty.
The login is enabled for the users with their data in the Backend, a new user cannot be assigned a login.
If a new user is to be added, the change must be done to the login table of the DBMS.
The cart fetches the data from the Relations in DBMS and is dynamic(Different for every user).
This project implements simple css and very simple functions of the ReactJs and SpringBoot.
This project is a step-forward to learn more things in the frameworks.
The next idea to build a ML based ReactJs+SpringBoot project, which implements analysis of data fetched from the database acting as a representation for my skills.
